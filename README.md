# clo-ui
UI components and styles shared across CLO* projects

## Usage
- Install peer deps `react` and `react-dom` at v18.
- Import only what you need from component subpaths.
- Global bundle still available when import from `clo-ui`.
- Run `yarn build` to emit CJS/ESM bundles with typed subpath exports.
